OpenBVE Multiplayer
---

This is a fork of the original OpenBve, the original website has been taken down, and there are no longer any official websites to download it from.  Since this product came out of [BVEStation.com](http://www.bvestation.com), we recommend you visit [BVEStation](http://www.bvestation.com) for a copy of the game.

This add-on will enable multiplayer support.

Important Files

Included is the tcpServer.py, which is a server written in Python.  The client code is within the repository.  The bulk of the code is in openBVE/OpenBve/OldCode/Multiplayer.cs.
